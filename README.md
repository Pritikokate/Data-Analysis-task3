# Data-Analysis-task3
This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The dataset is preprocessed using standardization to ensure uniform scaling, and the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and visualized through a WCSS plot. Key outputs include 2D scatter plots (using PCA), pair plots, and visualizations of cluster centroids for better interpretation. These insights enable businesses to identify high-spending customers, design loyalty programs, and create targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments, optimizing resource allocation and boosting engagement.
